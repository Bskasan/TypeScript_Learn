# TypeScript

## INTRODUCTION TO TYPESCRIPT

### What is the TypeScript ?

- Anders Hejlsberg began working on typescript at Microsoft in 2010, and the first version of typescript was given to the public in 2012. (ts 0.8)
- It is superset of JavaScript. That is, it's JavaScript with a bunch of additional features.
- TS codes are not be run directly like. TS codes are compiled into JavaScript. Your valid JS code is also valid TS code.
- Cross-platform ==> TS runs on any platform that JS runs on. The TS compiler can be intalled on any operating system.
- Object-oriented language ==> Powerful features such as classes, interfaces, and modules.
- Static type-checking ==> TS uses static typing, done using type annotations. Type checking is done at compile time.
- Optional static typing 
- DOM Manipulation ==> Just like JavaScript
- ES 6 Features ==> TS includes features of ES6
